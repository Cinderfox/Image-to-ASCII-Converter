## Introduction

The ASCII Art Generator showcases the artistic potential of programming by transforming regular images into ASCII-based artwork. This program leverages the capabilities of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate images and create stunning visual effects.

It's a relatively simple code for converting images to ASCII art.

## Features

The ASCII Art Generator boasts several noteworthy features:

- Conversion of Images: The program takes an input image and converts it into ASCII art, adding a creative twist to regular images.
- Customizable Output: The generated ASCII art output can be customized by modifying the list of ASCII characters used for shading.

## Installation

To set up the ASCII Art Generator on your system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the required library using the command: `pip install pillow`.

## Usage

Utilizing the ASCII Art Generator is straightforward:

1. Save the desired image in the same directory as the program, and replace `"pic.png"` with your image file name.
2. Run the program using a Python interpreter: `python convert.py`.

## How It Works

The ASCII Art Generator follows these steps to create visually appealing ASCII art:

### Image Processing

1. Load Image: The program uses the PIL library to open and load the input image. The image is converted to grayscale using the `convert('L')` method.
2. Resize: The image is resized to ensure that it fits within the desired width while maintaining the aspect ratio. This ensures that the ASCII art maintains its original proportions.
3. Processing Loop: The program processes each pixel in the resized image and determines its pixel value.
4. Character Mapping: The pixel value is used to map to a corresponding ASCII character based on its intensity. The program divides the pixel value by 25 and uses the result as an index to select the appropriate character from the predefined ASCII character set.

### ASCII Character Set

The program employs a set of ASCII characters ranging from light to dark, allowing for accurate representation of different shades. These characters are strategically selected to create a visually pleasing effect.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Library: Pillow (PIL)
